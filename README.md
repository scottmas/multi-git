Multi Git
========

A Git command line to manage multiple git repositories at once.

What's new ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* nodegit has been dropped in favor of simple-git. That way, you won't have to compile any dependency.
* Most common git commands are now supported.
* multi-git can be used from any directory, even if it's not listed in your configuration file.
* git-flow commands

Intended use
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you ever worked in a micro service environment, you've most likely been asked to worked with dozen of projects.
Keeping them up to date tends to be tedious.

This module aims to replace this :
````bash
$ cd group/project1
$ git pull
$ cd ../project2
$ git pull
$ cd ../project3
$ git pull
$ cd ../project4
$ git pull
$ cd ../project5
$ git pull
...
````
by that :
````javascript
$ cd group
$ multi-git pull
````

same goes for status, fetch ...

Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------
multi-git will try to read its configuration file from multiple locations in the following order:
1. the current working directory
2. the home directory
3. the module directory (which will most likely serve as default values)

This file must be named `.mg-config.json` and be in `json` format.

````json
{
    "projects": {
        "repo1": {
            "name": "repo1",
            "path": "/home/ubuntu/workspace/repos/repo1"
        },
        "repo2": {
            "name": "repo2",
            "path": "./repos/repo2"
        },
        "repo3": {
            "name": "repo3",
            "path": "/home/ubuntu/workspace/repos/repo3"
        }
    },
    "groups": {
        "awesome-group": {
            "name": "awesome-group",
            "members": [
                "repo1",
                "repo2"
            ]
        },
        "magnificent-group": {
            "name": "magnificent-group",
            "members": [
                "repo2",
                "repo3"
            ]
        }
    }
}
````

* Non absolute paths are resolved relative to the current working directory 
* Paths can contain ~
* A project can belong to multiple groups

Behaviour
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You can use multi-git with the _--group_ flag:
In that case multi-git will try to find the group by its name in the configuration file
and run the specified command on each group member.

or without:
In that case multi-git, if the current working directory is a git repository,
multi-git will run the specified command on each member of each group the cwd belongs ;
if not, it will run the command on each subdirectories of the cwd.
